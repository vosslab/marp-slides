# Pipeline architecture

This repository owns a native-object presentation pipeline. Marp Markdown and extended-Djot are
parallel source front ends; each produces the same presentation-neutral model and never calls Marp
code, Marp CLI, a browser, or a rendered-slide converter. Existing Marp decks remain the migration
baseline; `.djot` decks are a second, explicit presentation source form.

## Component map

```text
ONE-TIME LEGACY IMPORT

trusted legacy ODP -> LibreOffice temporary PPTX -> semantic normalization
  -> LegacySlidePlan -> extended-Djot + validated local assets

The original ODP supplies raster evidence for an ODP import, and the trusted input PPTX supplies it
for a direct PPTX import. The importer renders only a bounded, title-excluded source region through
Poppler's fixed `pdftoppm` 144 DPI path. It keeps ordinary text, pictures, and supported tables as
native editable source instead of producing an exact full-slide raster.

REPEATABLE BUILD

canonical Marp Markdown or extended-Djot source
  -> marp_lib.terminal_output
  -> marp_lib.native_export suffix dispatch
  -> marp_lib.marp_parser or marp_lib.djot_parser
  -> typed native slide-object model
  -> marp_lib.layouts
  -> python-pptx editable PPTX
  -> LibreOffice editable ODP
  -> LibreOffice PDF from that ODP
```

The PDF path is intentionally downstream of editable ODP. Rendering a final ODP-derived PDF for
visual QA is separate from the production object-conversion chain and never supplies slide content.

`terminal_output` invokes `native_export`, which selects a parser by source suffix and imports the
layout and LibreOffice owners. None of those lower-level owners imports the terminal interface. This
one-way boundary keeps presentation, parsing, geometry, conversion, and artifact orchestration
separate.

## Legacy import contract

Legacy normalization retains text, lists, images, tables, and geometry before selecting a target
layout. `LegacySlidePlan` is the source-neutral handoff: it carries a geometry-selected title,
editable slot candidates, true source-table metadata, and at most one coupled spatial content
region. The importer assigns a component as a complete unit; it does not reconstruct diagrams from
their labels or use deck-, slide-, or text-specific exceptions.

Ordinary source prose and pictures project to editable Djot blocks. Direct source style, placeholder
role, actual top/group z-path, signed rotation, and normalized geometry provide the evidence for
bounded coupled relations. A visible degenerate connector retains a narrow normalized footprint
rather than being silently lost. Ordinary layout selection runs through the shared registry-topology
matcher first; special relations are positive, bounded classifications rather than exceptions.

A narrow coarse-body and picture-inset pair remains two direct editable objects in `two-panels`,
using exact source provenance and one explicit permission. Caption pairing is a single shared
positive relation grouped before topology and reuses the existing `two-plus-one` and footer
permission. Adaptive vertical image flow reserves text at 28 through 14 CSS px, then uniformly
scales every image. These routes do not use global or crop exceptions.

A tightly coupled diagram and its distributed labels may project to one bounded component image. Its
private crop protects the selected title, includes only its coupled source members, and must remain
smaller than the original slide after pixel rounding. The original ODP supplies that evidence for an
ODP import, while a direct PPTX import uses its trusted input PPTX. Poppler renders source pages at
fixed 144 DPI; the importer validates decoded PNGs, records source-slide provenance, and publishes
digest-named assets only after the staged Djot source and assets validate together.

Publication also retains only assets reachable from the parsed Djot deck below that deck's local
`assets/` directory. Missing, unsafe, or symlinked references fail staging, and unreachable generated
files are pruned before the atomic publication step.

Only actual PPTX table metadata may become an editable native table. Header status and intentional
blank cells remain source-derived. Merged or spanned table cells require review before publication;
a diagram that merely resembles a grid stays a bounded component or review case. Ambiguous component
geometry likewise stops with a source-located review failure rather than silently changing teaching
content.

## Native layout contract

`marp_lib.layouts` has one distinct builder for each LibreOffice layout-grid entry:

- `blank`
- `title-only`
- `title-slide`
- `one-panel`
- `centered-text`
- `two-panels`
- `one-plus-two-panels`
- `two-plus-one-panels`
- `stacked-panels`
- `two-over-one-panels`
- `four-panels`
- `six-panels`
- `vertical-panel`
- `vertical-title-two-panels`
- `vertical-text-panel`
- `two-panels-vertical-clipart`
- `gallery`
- `multiple-choice`

The first sixteen names are the LibreOffice grid catalog. `gallery` is a repository layout for a
contained image row. LibreOffice is not asked to apply the grid: Python creates the text boxes,
lists, images, shapes, and vertical text direction directly through `python-pptx`.

Each Marp slide declares exactly one `_class`; its legacy blockquotes are normalized to named cells.
Each Djot slide begins with exact `=== layout: <name>` and uses exact `@<slot>` directives. The
layout registry is the authority for legal layout and slot names, including asymmetric slots:
`one-plus-two-panels` uses `left`, `top-right`, and `bottom-right`; `two-plus-one-panels` uses
`top-left`, `bottom-left`, and `right`; `two-panels-vertical-clipart` uses `top-left`,
`bottom-left`, and `right-clipart`. `gallery` accepts a slide title and two through six component
images; use `one-panel` for one image. Layout validation reports unsupported or overflowing source
rather than emitting a raster fallback.

Ordinary panel layouts accept zero or one global H1. Each ordinary cell may also carry one local H2
followed by native text, images, or one source-derived table. Before any shape is created, the
layout preflight gives a local heading its required height and fits body text from 28 down to 14 CSS
px. A title, heading, table, or body that cannot fit reports its source location before a partial
slide can exist.

An `_class` directive may also contain one bounded title-size modifier: `font-size-64`,
`font-size-80`, `font-size-96`, `font-size-120`, `font-size-160`, or `font-size-200`. The parser
stores it as a source-located typed request and the layout writer applies it only to the top-level
editable H1. It never changes subtitles, bodies, cells, links, or pagination. An explicit request
that cannot fit its assigned native title region fails at the H1 source line instead of shrinking.

## Marp-language boundary

The repository adopts Marp Core v5 only for its mature authoring-language specification.
Repository-owned Python handles the selected vocabulary: opening YAML front matter, slide
separators, `_class` and `_paginate` directives, headings, paragraphs,
formatted/link/inline-code runs, nested lists, standalone component images, blockquote cells, and
presenter-note comments. Tables plus fenced or indented code are source-located rejections until a
native editable-object owner is added. Other unsupported constructs also fail with a source path
and line number.

`OTHER_REPOS/marp-core` and `OTHER_REPOS/marp-cli` are local reference and conformance evidence.
The Marp Core snapshot is v5.0.1; v4 and earlier behavior is not a compatibility target. Both
clones are outside the runtime graph. Their HTML/browser and raster export paths are neither
invoked nor bundled.

## Extended-Djot language boundary

The Djot front end accepts exact whole-line layout and slot directives, global `#` titles and `##`
subtitles where their layout permits them, `<= appear`, `=> appear`, and `=> cascade appear`.
Several H2 lines on a title slide remain one subtitle region; they are not separate title objects.
Pre-element one-line Djot attributes attach to the next element. `![alt](path)` is a component image
only when it is a complete paragraph; mixed text-and-image paragraphs receive a source-located
unsupported-subset diagnostic. `$inline$` and `$$display$$` are intentional repository math
extensions after strict-Djot validation, but native math rendering is not implemented yet.

`multiple-choice` requires exactly `@question` and `@answer`. The question includes a visible choice
list; the answer is one or two short editable flat paragraphs with implicit object-appear intent.
The intent does not yet establish a playable PowerPoint first advance. `<= blue overlay` is
recognized and rejected as not yet supported. Attributes, quotes, inline math, and other valid Djot
constructs without an editable native mapping also fail source-located rather than disappearing.

## Verification lanes

| Lane | Establishes |
| --- | --- |
| Fast Python tests | Parser, layout validation, native object construction, and source diagnostics |
| Native semantic E2E | PPTX/ODP text, lists, links, notes, component images, counts, and no full-slide image |
| ODP-derived PDF review | Final-page containment and visual teaching clarity |
| Strict Jotdown gate | Raw-Djot syntax before project slide semantics |
| Legacy importer acceptance | Source conversion, full-corpus build, provenance, and visual comparisons |
| Native all-format acceptance | Eight sequential editable PPTX, ODP, and PDF exports with matching counts |
| Attended PowerPoint and Impress checks | Timing playback, repair behavior, and animation survival |

No one lane proves the complete product. Fast tests cannot prove LibreOffice conversion, and a
rendered page cannot prove editability. The E2E build verifies the ordered PPTX-to-ODP-to-PDF path.
The strict Jotdown gate is a one-time/source-acceptance check, not a replacement for permanent
offline parser tests. Importer conversion, a full-corpus build, visual comparisons, and native
all-format output are likewise one-time acceptance evidence. The native gate passed through strict
lint for 8 decks/336 visible slides/186 image occurrences, `build_slides.sh genetics`, three native
E2Es, and eight sequential matching PPTX/ODP/PDF exports with editable text/direct images and the
Lecture 02e native table retained. Permanent pytest remains offline, fast, and deterministic.
PowerPoint timing and ODP animation survival require attended evidence; see
[wp_a1_animation_fidelity.md](active_plans/reports/wp_a1_animation_fidelity.md).

## Durable source boundary

After one-time import, each deck has one selected canonical source form and local assets. PPTX, ODP,
and PDF are reproducible products. The Marp and Djot front ends coexist without creating a second
canonical source for any individual deck.

[USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the corresponding requirement, rationale, and authoring contract.
