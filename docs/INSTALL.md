# Install

This repository runs local Python commands against the checkout to create editable PPTX, ODP, and
PDF presentations. It also imports trusted legacy ODP or PPTX into extended-Djot source.

## Requirements

- macOS with Homebrew.
- Python 3.12; run repository Python commands through `source source_me.sh && python3`.
- LibreOffice Impress for ODP input and the editable PPTX -> ODP -> PDF conversion chain.
- Poppler, including `pdftoppm`, for bounded source-region assets during geometry-first import.
- The packages in `pip_requirements.txt`.
- Jotdown 0.10.0 on `PATH` for strict-Djot source acceptance. `source_me.sh` adds the conventional
  Cargo bin directory when it exists.

## Install tools

From the repository root, install the declared macOS tools and Python packages:

```bash
brew bundle
source source_me.sh && python3 -m pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```

The Brewfile installs Python 3.12, Poppler, and LibreOffice. Jotdown is a separate strict-Djot
validator. Confirm the required installed version before running the source-acceptance command in
[USAGE.md](USAGE.md):

```bash
source source_me.sh && jotdown --version
```

Expected output: `jotdown 0.10.0`.

## Verify install

```bash
source source_me.sh && python3 tools/marp_export.py --help
```

## Conversion boundary

Close the LibreOffice desktop application before a command that imports ODP or produces ODP/PDF.
The repository invokes LibreOffice headlessly through its established user profile.

Import only trusted instructor-owned ODP or PPTX files. Archive and image validation bounds
repository processing, but it does not sandbox LibreOffice or make an untrusted presentation safe
to open.

Continue with [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for import, source validation, and native export commands.
