# Presentation-language brainstorming

Status: working thoughts, not a syntax guide. This page retains the reasons behind the source-language
and syntax choices so that a future grammar is not designed as though its tradeoffs had never been
discussed. It authorizes neither parser work nor a public language name.

## The actual problem

This is not a search for a cleverer Marp theme. Markdown is good at content hierarchy; slides also
need spatial hierarchy. Classic Marp remains a useful migration and conformance baseline, but it
cannot name the regions needed for the teaching layouts in this repository. The open question is
what source language to start with and what small syntax should add those spatial semantics.

The repository will own the Python parser, native editable-object builders, LibreOffice bridge, and
validation regardless of the source language. An external renderer or presentation pipeline is
therefore not the deciding factor. The decision is about what an instructor can comfortably write
and what the parser can understand without guessing.

## Why Djot is attractive

A recent John MacFarlane interview prompted this line of thought: Markdown accumulated ambiguous
cases and competing interpretations, while Djot began with a more deliberate grammar. That is an
important design lesson for a slide language. The grammar must settle ambiguities before course decks,
tooling, and compatibility expectations grow around them.

Djot itself is not the current base-language choice. Its source would not display as ordinary
Markdown on GitHub, and it does not by itself answer the spatial-slide question. The useful part to
borrow is its specification discipline:

- Define the legal spelling and scope of every construct.
- State what a near-match means instead of silently guessing.
- Define how a construct interacts with code fences, lists, and other blocks.
- Reject source that has no stable native-slide meaning.

The timestamped transcript analysis is in
[markdown_djot_interview_notes.md](markdown_djot_interview_notes.md). It identifies the interview
lessons without treating either Djot or the interview as a chosen slide-language specification.

## GitHub and GFM

GitHub is where a deck is reviewed, linked, and read in raw source. It is not designed to display
spatial slides, so no authoring syntax can make its normal Markdown rendering a faithful slide view.
GitHub readability is therefore useful but must not decide the source foundation by itself.

GFM cannot be the complete slide language because it has no spatial model. It is a candidate
foundation because it offers familiar document syntax and broad generic Markdown display. That
benefit must be weighed against Djot's stronger grammar base and against useful Marp source
conventions; GFM is not selected.

### Optional display projection

The deck has one canonical authored source regardless of the foundation selected. If browsing on
GitHub proves valuable, the pipeline could optionally emit a derived, read-only GFM-friendly display
view: title, content in layout reading order, images, captions, and accessible links, but not a
claim to reproduce slide geometry or builds. This is an optional display artifact, not a second
source, authoring input, or parser input. It may be unnecessary and must not drive the language
choice.

## What authoring should feel like

- Write ordinary nested bulleted and numbered lists inside a named region.
- Use ordinary Markdown image source where an image belongs.
- Use hand-writable, LaTeX-compatible inline and display math.
- Name a recurring teaching layout instead of repeating geometry or CSS.
- Name the region where content belongs instead of relying on its ordinal position.
- Keep routine structure shorter than HTML tags, HTML comments, or deeply nested containers.
- Reveal an authored item or outline one item at a time without a general animation language.
- Preserve text, lists, practical equations, and images as editable native PPTX and ODP objects.

Raw HTML tags and `<!-- ... -->` comments are technically precise but spend too many characters on
routine structure. They are poor default authoring syntax even when they pass through a Markdown
renderer. Content-shape inference is also not enough: an author must be able to request asymmetry,
captions, galleries, and repeated teaching layouts explicitly.

## Starting points considered

| Start with | What it contributes | Open concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GFM | Familiar document syntax and broad generic display. | The extension must close Markdown's layout ambiguities. |
| Djot | Deliberate grammar discipline. | GitHub does not display it as ordinary Markdown, and slide semantics still need design. |
| Marp-derived surface | Familiar slide headings and migration continuity. | Classic Marp lacks spatial semantics and must not constrain the successor. |
| Surveyed presentation format | Individual prior-art ideas. | No direct-adoption candidate currently meets the authoring requirements. |

The prior-art evidence remains in [LAYOUT_LANGUAGE_SURVEY.md](../../LAYOUT_LANGUAGE_SURVEY.md) and
[MARP_ADJACENT_PROJECT_COMPARISON.md](../../MARP_ADJACENT_PROJECT_COMPARISON.md).

## Candidate syntax idea

This shape is worth exploring because it makes a layout and its regions visible without containers,
tags, comments, or per-slide geometry:

```markdown
@layout comparison

# Actin and microtubules

:: left
- Actin filaments
  - Support membrane shape

:: right
- Microtubules
  - Form the mitotic spindle
```

The possible reading is simple:

- `@layout comparison` selects a named teaching layout.
- `#` remains a familiar slide title.
- `:: left` and `:: right` begin named regions.
- Ordinary Markdown blocks continue until the next region or slide boundary.

That reading is an illustration, not a contract. The final language may keep these tokens, revise
them, or choose a better visible form. This syntax idea does not select GFM, Djot, or Marp as its
foundation. The principle is more important than the spelling: the chosen content language needs a
small structural layer for spatial slides.

## What must be unambiguous

The first grammar proposal must choose exact answers rather than leaving them to implementation.

| Topic | Rule the grammar must state |
| --- | --- |
| Slide boundary | How slides divide without confusing a normal GFM horizontal rule. |
| Layout line | Where it may occur, its exact name syntax, and whether every slide needs one. |
| Slot line | Where it may occur, its exact name syntax, how it ends, and how literal matching text is escaped. |
| Title and subtitle | Which headings have slide-level meaning and which remain region content. |
| Layout contract | Which slots are required, optional, repeatable, and ordered for each layout. |
| Content-language scope | The selected source specification and allowed extensions inside a slot. |
| Code and YAML | Whether directive-looking text is inert inside YAML, indented code, and fenced code. |
| Images and captions | Whether each uses an explicit region or another equally unambiguous construct. |
| Mathematics | The exact inline and display delimiters, including currency and escaping rules. |
| Reveals | A short source form for item builds and arbitrary-item appearance, plus nesting behavior. |
| Failure | The source-located error for unknown layouts, slots, directives, duplicates, and omissions. |

No grammar rule should depend on CSS, source order, content shape, accidental whitespace, or a
browser's recovery behavior. The parser should either construct a typed native-slide model or state
what needs correction.

## Naming thoughts

The successor should not be called Marp+ by default. It may diverge far enough from Marp that a new
name is clearer for authors and readers. Naming should follow the approved grammar, not lead it:
calling it Marp+ too early would suggest a compatibility promise that the project does not intend to
make.

## Next small experiment

Compare small candidate grammars over GFM, Djot, and a Marp-derived surface. Express all fifteen
survey fixtures and deliberately ambiguous near-matches in each serious candidate. Review the source
readability, written grammar, resulting parse, diagnostics, and native model together before
selecting the foundation, naming the language, creating its guide, or writing implementation code.
