## Slide migration and presentation

- I do not own any microsoft products, Powerpoint is not a blocker, we only use PPTX because
  python supports PPTX better than ODP
- Legacy ODP is imported once; Marp Markdown and its local assets then become authoritative.
- Use Marp because it has a mature language specification. The production build uses neither Marp
  code nor Marp CLI.
- Use Marp Core v5 only as the upstream authoring and conformance baseline. Do not support Marp
  Core v4 or earlier behavior.
- Keep classic Marp Markdown as the migration baseline while the successor language is defined.
  Clearly separate standard Marp syntax from repository-owned language work.
- Do not show slide numbers; they encourage the audience to track remaining time and watch the
  clock instead of the presenter.
- `OTHER_REPOS/marp-core` and `OTHER_REPOS/marp-cli` are interpretation and conformance evidence,
  not production dependencies, runtimes, or renderers.
- Build canonical Marp Markdown through repository-owned Python into native editable PPTX objects,
  then use LibreOffice to make editable ODP, then make PDF from that ODP.
- git is out of scope; I saw something messing with staging
- Run LibreOffice conversion with `--headless --norestore` through the established user profile.
  Keep LibreOffice closed during the batch build; use `--safe-mode` when repairing profile problems.
- Export ODP to PDF with the Impress PDF filter, 70 percent JPEG quality, a documented 150 DPI image
  limit, and PDF/A-3b output.
- Implement every individual LibreOffice layout-grid pattern as native editable Python objects, plus
  the repository `gallery` layout. The grid is a visual catalog, not a rendering dependency.
- Use layouts `blank`, `title-only`, `title-slide`, `one-panel`, `centered-text`, `two-panels`,
  `one-plus-two-panels`, and `two-plus-one-panels`.
- Use layouts `stacked-panels`, `two-over-one-panels`, `four-panels`, `six-panels`,
  `vertical-panel`, `vertical-title-two-panels`, `vertical-text-panel`,
  `two-panels-vertical-clipart`, `gallery`, and `multiple-choice`.
- Give every slide exactly one explicit layout class. Keep `-` as ordinary list syntax and `>` as
  a standard Markdown blockquote; do not use comment-based cell markers for normal layout structure.
- Use a bounded Marp `font-size-N` companion class when an H1 such as `THE END` should occupy the
  slide; keep the title editable and leave normal slide text at its layout size.
- Preserve text, lists, component images, links, layouts, and presenter notes as native objects.
- Treat every full-slide raster image or raster fallback in generated PPTX, ODP, or PDF production
  as a failed product result. A browser is not a normal build dependency.
- Use the heavily edited `md2pptx` clone for native-object implementation ideas while retaining
  Marp syntax as this repository's authoring contract.
- Use a `marp_lib` folder for common reusable functions that other presentation scripts import.
- Have `build_slides.sh` build every Marp deck in a selected folder; keep `marp_to_odp.py` and
  `marp_to_pptx.py` as obvious single-deck commands.
- Keep presentation-build output concise: show the current deck and stage transiently, then leave
  one compact summary with relative paths, file sizes, and one elapsed total. Hide successful
  third-party conversion chatter.
- Prefer simple teaching layouts instead of copying arbitrary legacy ODP geometry. Keep authored
  text and images within the 1280x800 16:10 frame, and fit component images with `contain`.
- Preserve the teaching sequence unless I explicitly approve a change.
- My ODP slides are hand-authored structured documents, not scans; normal conversion uses text and
  image objects rather than OCR.
- Use OpenDyslexic for ordinary slide text and PT Sans Narrow only when a long URL is displayed.
- Use OpenDyslexic for ordinary and inline-code runs. Apply PT Sans Narrow only to a displayed
  literal URL; keep ordinary linked labels in OpenDyslexic with their native hyperlink.
- Treat `slide_*_source` raster names as retired full-slide fallback evidence, not component images.
- For `vertical-text-panel` and `vertical-panel`, author one level-one title and one
  root body block: one paragraph, one list, or one component image.
- Use lots of images and aim for a visual image on every slide.
- Avoid raw HTML or XML in Markdown. Keep preview styling in the shared CSS theme.
- A normal instructor workflow must not require VS Code, npm, TypeScript, Node, or a Marp server.
- This pre-production repository uses direct replacements when terminology or architecture changes.
  Improve foundational schemas, contracts, abstractions, and ownership boundaries directly; do not
  preserve compatibility shims or legacy support.

- Keep a separate Markdown review for every repository in `OTHER_REPOS/` that identifies its
  content and whether its ideas, code, functions, themes, or assets fit this project.
- Evaluate these repositories for useful ideas rather than license analysis when source copying is
  out of scope. Prioritize correctness, maintainability, validation, and delivery risks over
  trivial details.
- Review each repository for whether it improves an active task, offers a stronger pipeline model,
  or shows a useful possibility for Marp and its themes.
- Marp is not feature-complete for the planned teaching layouts. Explore a coherent, independently
  named language instead of adopting CDL or a rushed custom language wholesale.
- Do not route an extension language through Marp CLI. The repository-owned native exporter is the
  rendering boundary.
- Survey every `OTHER_REPOS/` project for how it handles Marp's missing layout vocabulary. Separate
  semantic language extensions, CSS visual catalogs, output transformations, and unrelated tools.
- Classic Marp is known not to support the required slide layouts. The remaining decision is whether
  to define a small new language or adopt another Markdown presentation language; do not imply that
  standard Marp is sufficient.
- Produce decision-support documentation before creating a future language guide or changing the
  parser. Compare literal source for recurring teaching layouts, and investigate existing Marp
  extensions as attempts to bridge linear Markdown content to spatial slide structure.
- Judge the choice by hand-authoring quality, ordinary nested Markdown, structural punctuation and
  comment burden, semantic layout names, and a clean mapping to typed editable native slide
  objects. Treat the repository Python parser and exporter as the rendering boundary.
- The future slide-language wishlist is:
  - Multiple named teaching layouts, including title slide, title plus content, two equal columns,
    asymmetric columns, stacked regions, 2x2, 3x2, and related LibreOffice-style patterns.
  - Ordinary nested bulleted and numbered lists inside every content region.
  - Simple Markdown image insertion with predictable placement inside a named region.
  - Equation support, using LaTeX-compatible syntax or a similarly capable hand-writable equation
    syntax, for both inline and display math without turning the language into a
    scientific-publishing framework.
  - Simple teaching animation: on an advance, make an authored item appear or reveal an outline one
    bullet at a time. Complex motion paths, timing tracks, and animation choreography are not needed.
  - Hand-writable source with very little structural punctuation or comment scaffolding.
  - Native editable output: text, lists, practical equations, and images remain real PPTX and ODP
    objects, never slide screenshots.
- These are requirements for the language choice, not approval for a particular grammar.
- Regardless of the chosen source language, the repository will own the parser, native editable
  PPTX/ODP builders, LibreOffice bridge, and validation. "Adopt a language" means adopt or adapt
  its source grammar and semantics, never its runtime or presentation pipeline.
- No surveyed presentation format is a direct-adoption target. The successor language is extended
  Djot; its implemented spatial grammar remains adaptable as new native owners gain evidence.
- Require accepted source to remain strict Djot and pass the pinned compatibility suite before
  extension lint applies slide semantics. No slide feature may waive a Djot failure.
- Treat the pinned native Djot parser as a syntax-validation lane of that suite: in ordinary use, it
  is a validator/linter for raw Djot structure. The extension linter adds only slide-specific
  diagnostics after the parser validates the underlying document.
- Hands-on Djot specimens confirm this choice: its visible, line-by-line parsing behavior, removal
  of indented code blocks, and simpler list-item indentation rule make authored source easy to read
  and reason about.
- I want the extended Djot language to retain Djot's design goals: linear and local parsing, simple
  list and inline behavior, hard-wrap-friendly source, uniform composition, preserved attributes and
  containers, and the simplest syntax consistent with those constraints.
- I particularly value source that remains readable when hard-wrapped. Keep every slide directive
  short and single-line so wrapping ordinary teaching prose never creates or changes structure.
- Avoid braces and other paired punctuation in normal slide authoring. Retain one-line Djot
  attributes for exceptional content or renderer overrides, never as the default layout, slot,
  gallery, reveal, size, or color vocabulary; never use multiline brace structures.
- The Djot slide surface uses `=== layout: <name>` to start a slide and choose its layout, and
  `@<slot>` to select a predefined slot from that layout. The parser and layout catalog implement
  these spellings while keeping new grammar decisions evidence-driven.
- The Djot layout catalog includes every default LibreOffice layout plus the custom
  `multiple-choice` layout. Preserve familiar Marp content where compatible with Djot; `=== layout:`
  replaces Marp's `---` slide separator, and Marp-specific image modifiers are not adopted.
- In title-bearing layouts, `#` supplies the title; in subtitle-bearing layouts, `##` supplies the
  subtitle. Layouts without title placement reject both headings.
- Use `<= <action>` as a terminal animation directive for the preceding item or block and
  `=> <action>` as a prefix directive for the following block. `=> cascade appear` reveals the
  following outline or list one top-level item at a time in source order.
- I like the visual presence of Marp Extended's `%%` markers, but not their XML-like closing pairs.
  Keep one-sided `%% name` available for small parser examples; do not assume its scope or role yet.
- Kova's `|||` split delimiter is notable prior art, but triple repeated characters are not ideal for
  ordinary authoring.
- `multiple-choice` requires `@question` and `@answer`. The question and choices show initially;
  the answer appears in a bottom-right popup. Use another layout for open-ended questions.
- Reserve `![alt](path)`, `$inline$`, and `$$display$$` for component images and mathematics.
  A repository-owned adapter may accept the math surface without adopting Marp image modifiers.
- The Djot language supports normal Djot syntax. Use Djot tables for tabular source, inline
  verbatim for short fixed-width sequences, and fenced code blocks for aligned multiline sequence
  text; do not introduce special biological-sequence syntax.
- Support ASCII source that projects to Unicode after strict-Djot validation. The literal ASCII
  token `&prime;` maps to Unicode code point U+2032 PRIME; never rewrite verbatim or raw content.
- Use the upstream `.djot` suffix for extended-Djot presentation source. The extension's slide
  semantics come from its grammar, not a separate `.djp`, `.djs`, or `.djots` filename convention.
- Do not add a successor-language presenter-note syntax. Djot footnotes are audience-facing
  citations or clarifications, not hidden speaker notes; the existing importer still preserves
  notes from historical decks.
- A declared layout, rather than image count, should ultimately own slot capacity and geometry. Do
  not silently change a slide's selected layout because of image count.
- Keep teaching reveals within a small predefined action set rather than a general animation
  language. The provisional `<=` and `=>` spellings do not settle floating-answer geometry.
- Explore `<= blue overlay` as a bounded action for an authored annotation or popup highlight. It
  may become a predefined treatment, never a general color or coordinate attribute bag. In a slot
  with exactly one Marp image, it anchors to that image; otherwise the linter reports an error.
- For an inline blue highlight, write the target as the unquoted remainder of `<= blue overlay`.
  It must occur exactly once in the preceding logical item; the linter rejects missing or ambiguous
  targets. This preserves hard-wrapping and avoids escaping DNA prime marks inside quoted strings.
- Write a simple, fast, source-only linter with pyflakes-level enforcement. It must report
  source-located structural mistakes without rendering or opening LibreOffice; geometry, overflow,
  native animation export, and visual quality remain separate validation lanes.
- Treat Djot's explicit, unambiguous grammar as the compatibility basis for the extension. Do not
  require raw HTML tags or `<!-- ... -->` comments for normal slide structure.
- Do not call the successor language Marp+ by default. It may diverge substantially from Marp and
  should receive its own name after its grammar is selected.
- Keep one canonical authored source. Do not characterize the language discussion as a proposal for
  a separate GFM review copy and a presentation copy.
- Eventually separate reusable slide-language work from this repository's personal lecture content.
  Until an explicit migration plan exists, keep the current language exploration and course content
  together here; do not create a second content authority or prematurely split implementation.

## Working style

- Have single-repository propagation add a `devel/changelog_lib.py`-compatible changelog entry only
  when it makes real changes; recurring `.gitignore` churn must not create one.
- Classify one-time implementation checks separately from permanent tests. Apply the permanent
  pytest checklist, keep temporary proof out of the suite, and remove a test when in doubt.
- Prompt positively: state the desired action directly and keep safety or correctness boundaries
  explicit.
- Use parallel, atomic delegation when it reduces wall time; subagents and tokens are cheap.
- Favor adaptable, long-term designs that build on the existing ambition of the repository.
- Treat this pre-production codebase as a place to keep only durable tests with meaningful behavior.
